PowerBall Mechanics:

Use rotation keys to rotate the platform to maneuver the balls around the maze.
Use the rotate camera keys to rotate the camera around the platform to get a better view of what is happening.

A charging power plant is a plant that has its top lit up and the light on the ground matches that light. Roll a ball into the ground light to charge the ball with that color electricity, no matter what color electricity the ball currently has.

A receiver power plant is a plant that has its top either unlit, or its top is lit with a different color than the light on the ground. Roll a powered ball by the receiving plant and it will be charged with that color electricity and decharge the ball. If a receiving power plant is charged with the same color electricity as the colored light on the ground, then the light on the ground will disappear, signaling that it has been properly charged. If you then roll a differently charged ball by the receiving plant, it will change to that color and the light on the ground will reappear, signaling that you need to recharge that plant with the correct color.

You can collide two balls together to transfer charge. A neutral ball colliding with any other non-neutral ball will get charged with the properties of the other ball. A ball charged with one of the primary colors (red, yellow, blue) is collided with another ball charged with a primary color, then they will both become the combination of their primary colors (orange, green, purple). If a ball charged with a secondary color collides with a ball charged with a primary color, then both balls will be charged with the primary color. If two balls charged with secondary colors collide, nothing will happen.

To win levels, fill all ground connection holes with their required colored electric ball and/or charge all receiving power plants with their required colored electricity.


Level Solutions:
1. Maneuver the neutral ball to the red charging plant and then maneuver the now red charged ball to the hole requiring a red charge to fix the ground connection.

2. Maneuver each of the neutral balls to the yellow charging plant and then maneuver the now yellow charged balls to a hole requiring a yellow charge to fix the ground connections.

3. Maneuver the two balls (one blue charged, and one neutral) to collide, so that both are blue charged. Then maneuver them each to a hole requiring blue charge to fix the ground connections.

4. Maneuver the neutral ball to the red charging plant to charge the ball red and then maneuver it to the receiving plant, which requires a red charge, to charge the plant red.

5. Maneuver the neutral ball to the yellow charging plant to charge the ball yellow and then maneuver it to one of the receiving plants requiring a yellow charge to charge that plant yellow. Return to the charging plant to recharge the now neutral ball to be yellow charged again and then maneuver to the other receiving plant to charge it yellow.

6. Charge the neutral ball yellow at the yellow charging plant and then maneuver the blue charged ball out of the way. Then maneuver the now yellow charged ball toward the receiving plant requring a yellow charge while avoiding a collision with the blue ball. Then maneuver the blue ball to the hole requiring a blue charge to fix the ground connection. (Be sure not to fix the ground connection before moving the yellow ball past the hole, as the balls will still combine colors if one is in a hole, making the level unbeatable, requiring you to reset the level. No this is not a bug. This is intentional.)

7. Maneuver the neutral ball to the red charging station to charge it red and then maneuver the blue charged ball to collide with the red charged ball to turn them both purple. Then maneuver one of the purple charged balls to the receiving plant requiring a purple charge and the other to the hole requiring a purple charge to fix one of the ground connections. Then maneuver the now neutral ball back to the red charging plant to charge it red and then maneuver it to the hole requiring a red charge to fix the final ground connection.

8. Maneuver one of the neutral balls to the yellow charging plant and the other to the red charging plant to charge both balls. Then maneuver them to collide to turn them both orange. With one of the orange charged balls, maneuver it to the receiving plant that requires orange electricity to charge it. After the orange receiving plant has been charged, maneuver one of the two balls to the yellow charging plant to charge it yellow and maneuver the other ball to the blue charging plant to charge it blue. Then collide the two balls to make both green charged. Maneuver one of the green charged balls into the hole requiring a green charge to fix one of the ground connections. Maneuver the other green ball to the yellow charging plant to charge it yellow and then maneuver that ball around the maze to the hole requiring a yellow charge to fix the final ground connection and complete the level (be careful to avoid the green ball in the hole and the orange receiving plant as changing either of these colors will make the level unbeatable. Yet again, not a bug, completely intentional to make the levels a bit more difficult).

Hope you enjoy.
